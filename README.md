# Hello Citeproc

This repo is a web app with a single page with a single button:
http://yoavram.github.io/hello-citeproc/hello-citeproc.html
When you click the button a citation is added inline and to a bibliograhy.
That's it, it is a simple [citeproc-js] hello world with batteries included and nothing else.
